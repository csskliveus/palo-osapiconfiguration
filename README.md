# paloalto-azureterraform
This repo is a POC for updating palo alto configuration with terraform. 
Terragrunt configuration and terraform are used.
Version: 
panos        = 1.6.3
terraform    = v0.12.29
terragrunt   = v0.23.33

Yet to do
  1. Policies yet to be tested in this repo.
  2. DNS proxy feature is not available in Panos terraform module. 
  3. Need to find out what other features are not available, work in progress.
